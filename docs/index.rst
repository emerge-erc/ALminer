ALminer: ALMA Archive Mining & Visualization Toolkit
====================================================

``alminer`` is a Python-based code to effectively query, analyse, and
visualize the `ALMA science archive`_. It also allows users to
directly download ALMA data products and/or raw data for further image
processing.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install ``alminer`` is with ``pip``:

``pip install alminer``

To obtain the most recent version of the code from `GitHub`_:

``pip install https://github.com/emerge-erc/ALminer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip``

Or clone and install from source:

::

    # If you have a Github account:
    git clone git@github.com:emerge-erc/ALminer.git
    # If you do not:
    git clone https://github.com/emerge-erc/ALminer.git

    # After cloning:
    cd ALminer
    pip install .

Note that depending on your setup, you may need to use pip3.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dependencies are ``numpy``, ``matplotlib``,
`pandas`_, `pyvo`_, `astropy`_ version 3.1.2 or higher, and
`astroquery`_ version 0.4.2.dev6649 or higher. We only use the ``astroquery`` package
for downloading data from the ALMA archive. The strict requirement to
have its newest version is due to recent changes made to the ALMA
archive. ``alminer`` works in Python 3.


Getting started
---------------

We have created an extensive `tutorial Jupyter Notebook`_
where all ``alminer`` features have been highlighted. This is an
excellent starting point to get familiar with all the possibilities; a
glossary of all functions is provided at the bottom of this notebook. We
highly recommend working in a `Jupyter notebook environment`_ in order to make use of
``alminer``'s visualization tools. We aim to keep adding new notebooks
relevant for various sub-fields in the future.

``alminer`` has been developed through a collaboration between
`Allegro`_, the ALMA Regional Centre in
The Netherlands, and the University of Vienna as part of the `EMERGE-StG
project`_. This project has received
funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European
Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant agreement
No. 851435).

be added to the `GitHub`_ page when available).

``alminer`` makes use of different routines in
`Astropy`_ and `Astroquery`_. Please
also consider citing the following papers: - Astropy: `Astropy Collaboration et al. 2013`_
- Astroquery: `Ginsburg et al. 2019`_

We also acknowledge the work of Leiden University M.Sc. students, Robin
Mentel and David van Dop, who contributed to early versions of this
work.
