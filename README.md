# ALminer: ALMA Archive Mining & Visualization Toolkit

`alminer` is a Python-based code to effectively query, analyse, and visualize the [ALMA science archive](https://almascience.eso.org/aq/). It also allows users to directly download ALMA data products and/or raw data for further image processing.

## Installation

The easiest way to install `alminer` is with `pip`:

```pip install alminer```

To obtain the most recent version of the code from Github:

```pip install https://github.com/emerge-erc/ALminer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip```

Or clone and install from source:
```
# If you have a Github account:
git clone git@github.com:emerge-erc/ALminer.git
# If you do not:
git clone https://github.com/emerge-erc/ALminer.git

# After cloning:
cd ALminer
pip install .
```

Note that depending on your setup, you may need to use pip3.

### Dependencies

The dependencies are `numpy`, `matplotlib`, [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [`pyvo`](https://pyvo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [`astropy`](https://www.astropy.org/) version 3.1.2 or higher, and [`astroquery`](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) version 0.4.2.dev6649 or higher. We only use the `astroquery` package for downloading data from the ALMA archive. The strict requirement to have its newest version is due to recent changes made to the ALMA archive. `alminer` works in Python 3. 


## Getting started

We have created an extensive [tutorial Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/emerge-erc/ALminer/blob/main/notebooks/tutorial/ALminer_tutorial.ipynb?flush_cache=True) where all `alminer` features have been highlighted. This is an excellent starting point to get familiar with all the possibilities; a glossery of all functions is provided at the bottom of this notebook.

|------|

We highly recommend working in a [Jupyter notebook environment](https://jupyter.org/install) in order to make use of `alminer`'s visualization tools. We aim to keep adding new notebooks relevant for various sub-fields in the future.

## Documentation

More information can be found in the [documentation](https://alminer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).

### What's new:

- You can now specify which archive service to query: [ESO](https://almascience.eso.org/tap) is the default, and other options are [NRAO](https://almascience.nrao.edu/tap) and [NAOJ](https://almascience.nrao.edu/tap). This option can be given through the *'tap_service'* parameter to all functions that do the query (e.g. keysearch, target, catalog). For example:
  - ```alminer.target(["TW Hya", "HL Tau"], tap_service='NRAO')```
  - Note that currently the ESO service is not returning all results, hence it is advisable to test your queries with multiple services until further notice.
- It is now possible to query entire phrases with the `keysearch` function. For example:
  - ```alminer.keysearch({'proposal_abstract': ['"high-mass star formation" outflow disk']})``` will query the proposal abstracts for the phrase *high-mass star formation* AND the words *outflow* AND *disk*.
  - ```alminer.keysearch({'proposal_abstract': ['"high-mass star formation" outflow disk', '"massive star formation" outflow disk']}) ``` will query the the proposal abstracts for the phrase *high-mass star formation* AND the words *outflow* AND *disk* OR the phrase *massive star formation* AND the words *outflow* AND *disk*.
